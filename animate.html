    <p class="logline">
       At their core, video games are animations. And, unlike most failed live-action video game adaptations, animated adaptations of video 
       games are well-developed. Just think of Angry Birds and Wreck-It Ralph!

   Following Schulzke's criteria for a successful video game adaptation, and my aesthetic claim, I thought of a concept for a direct adaptation of the Tetris 
   video game. Here is the plot to my animated short film and some accompanying visuals developed by Adobe Firefly:

</p>
<p class="logline">
   A little girl who loves to game falls in love with Tetris. She becomes so obsessed that she signs up to compete in an online Tetris tournament. Her relentless training (finger exercises) in preparation
   for the competition exhausts her. On the day of the big tournament, she starts to see the blocks as living creatures! Whenever too many blocks
   stack on top of each other without clearing a level, the blocks start to suffer because they can't bear the weight! The blocks start talking to the
   girl, begging for help. Now the girl has a new mission: she must use her training to save lives!
 </p>

 <p class="logline">
    My proposed film is also conscious of the source material: Tetris lacks substance for a feature length film, which
    is why it is more suited for a short film.
