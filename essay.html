<div class="essay">

    <p> 
        <span class="highlight">Web.</span> A web is a network of fine threads constructed by a spider from fluid secreted by its spinnerets, used to catch its prey (“Web”). Not the definition you were expecting? With the rise of the digital age, the word has come to embody a new definition: The web is now a massive, complex, and interconnected system for accessing and sharing information instead of the architectural accomplishment of an arachnid. Technology is so deeply embedded in our society that it has changed our mental pathways—we now internalize words like cloud and footprint to mean their digital definitions. Language is not the only aspect of our culture that has been altered by this era of technological hegemony. The Internet has drastically changed the way in which consumers interact with each other and cultural products, such as films. Jenkins recognized the power of web communities in expanding upon intellectual property (35). For this reason, I was inspired to code an interactive website and analyze a cultural product.

        My website uses the Tetris (2023) film as a case study to examine video game adaptations, franchising, and media convergence. I believe the website format is justified for a few reasons. I claim that websites are the cousins of video games. They both fall under the umbrella of participatory interactivity, and as such, they share many elements. For instance, they both ask users for input. Websites include links, surveys, and buttons for the user to interact with. Additionally, both mediums include graphic elements like animations that immerse the user in the game or web world. Most importantly, the user always has a goal when interacting with either medium. In the case of websites, the goal is usually to collect information. I also expand upon Tetris by proposing an animated film adapted from the game. By creating fan-fiction on my website, I am participating in what Jenkins calls the “bottom-up consumer driven process” of media convergence (37). This is yet another justification for the format of my final project.

        Tetris is based on the true historical origin story of the invention of the game, so strictly speaking, the film is not a direct adaptation of the video game. However, the film follows many of Schulke’s criteria of a successful video game adaptation. He claims that a successful film adaptation of a game should “focus on not only filling in the gaps in story and character development...but also on creating new interpretative challenges” (72). Since the game does not have characters or a plot, Tetris conveniently uses real life to inspire the narrative’s dynamic characters. The film also introduces new interpretive challenges that were not originally a part of the game. Instead of relying on Tetris for a plot, the film takes the cultural, historical, and technological context in which Tetris was invented to build a narrative. In doing so, Tetris is transformed into a commentary on the innerworkings of media conglomerates and the way in which intellectual property rights spread world-wide. And, while the film is not an adaptation of the Tetris video game, an argument can be made that it is an adaptation of the video game medium.

        The film wants to be a video game. There are numerous animated sequences sprinkled throughout this live-action narrative. These sequences are pixelated graphics that follow the conventions of video game storytelling. The animations introduce the key “players” involved in the race to acquire the rights to the video game. They also notify viewers when there is a change in “level.” Whenever new obstacles are presented to the protagonist, an animated scene increases the level of the narrative. An article titled, “Animation Forms in Video Games and a Classification Study Based on Video Game Mechanics” outlines three types of animations used in video games: (1) Non-Interactive Animation, (2) Semi-Interactive Animation, and (3) Interactive Animation (ÜSTÜN, 1401). Non-Interactive animation is defined as “sections…generally used to tell the story of the game and explain the events” (ÜSTÜN, 1401). Due to the limitations of its medium, Tetris could not adapt the Semi-Interactive and Interactive Animations found in video games, but it could adapt Non-Interactive Animations to propel the story. By doing so, the film simulates the experience of playing a video game.

        The animated scenes in Tetris lead to the aesthetic argument that I raise in the last page of my website: Animated films should be the primary cinematic form to adapt video games. If Apple TV had produced two versions of Tetris, one with the animated sequences and one without, most viewers would choose to watch the film with the animations. Tetris would not have the same aesthetic effect if it had been done without adapting the Non-Interactive Animations typical to video games. In his essay titled, “Video Games and Their Relationship with Other Media,” Martin Picard notes that “fewer and less known are the adaptations of video games to comics and animation” (5). Given that video games and animated films essentially share the same medium, it seems only natural to adapt video game narratives into animated worlds. Yet, production companies continue to translate games into live-action films. As Schulzke points out in his essay, these live-action adaptations often fail. However, animated movies like Angry Birds or Wreck-It Ralph are extremely entertaining and present well-developed characters and plots. Animation presents unlimited possibilities, which is why the medium supports stronger narratives. Since video games often lack substance, they must be translated to a medium capable of developing the shallow source material. Furthermore, if a video game simply does not have enough material for a feature-length film, then it is best to adapt it into a short film.

        An entire page of my website is dedicated to media convergence because my case study presents an infant top-down corporate-driven process in action. Video game rights, arcade rights, and handheld rights to Tetris were all up for grabs in 1988. The race to acquire three different types of licensing rights to Tetris is an early example of media companies working to spread intellectual property in order to expand revenue (Jenkins, 37). Each company in the film had the exact same strategy: make Tetris as accessible as possible by spreading the game across multiple different consumer platforms. This strategy is franchising. The very act of making a Tetris film carries on the video game into a new medium and a new audience, thus expanding the franchise that was born in 1988. The film is also an example of the legal battles that arise due to the nuances in licensing intellectual property. The Soviet Union’s state-owned organization, Elorg, sold Tetris for personal computers to the company, Andromeda, or so they believed. Elorg did not properly define computers to include keyboards, so Andromeda began selling the video game rights to Tetris. While Andromeda legally sold the video game rights, they stole the arcade rights. According to Jenkins, this legal conflict is a byproduct of the corporate process. Jenkins also calls for the “remapping of globalization” (41). He claims that there is often a focus on the flow of media from the West to the East, even though Eastern media has also taken root in the West (41). If we are to consider the Soviet Union as an Eastern market, then Tetris is one of the earliest media products to spearhead the flow of media from the East to West. Even if we are to regard the Soviet Union as a Western market, it was Japan that introduced Tetris on the Gameboy to Western consumers.

        Tetris is a cultural artifact. Not only does it tell the story of an enduring video game, but it is also a case study into the ways in which media is currently produced and consumed. The film’s aesthetic choices stay true to the source material and make it a model for future video game adaptations, wherein the cinematic mode is animation. Every pixel that composes our cultural screen is represented in the film: the spread of intellectual property, artistry, technological innovation, consumer markets, corporate strategies, and global franchises. My website is an extension of Tetris—the final block to fall into place.
